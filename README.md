Resources for tracking my 2021 virtual walk/cycle.

## Goal
To add up my walking and cycling throughout 2021 map to a Hannibal-inspired route from Cartagena to Carthage. Via the Alps. Total distance: 3252km (2021 miles!); pace: 8.91km/day.

## To Do
[x] Get data for European leg of journey from Google Earth  
[x] Process the Europe data to determine how far the African stage needs to be  
[ ] Decide route and get data for African leg of journey from Google Earth (needs to be 317.780km)  
[ ] Write script to read GFit data into R  
[ ] Write script to compare GFit data to route data, calculate progress  
[ ] Visualise position on route (leaflet)
